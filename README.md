Employees-Manager
this app is that a manager of a small business can add their employees. and then designate a schedule for them. So like maybe a shift starting on Monday and then text that schedule to the particular employee. So definitely a practical use case here if I was running like a small business like say McDonald's or subway or something like that. And I just want to manage the schedules and while all my employees. And then once I set the schedule I want to text it directly to the employee.
